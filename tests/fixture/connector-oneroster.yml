# This is a sample configuration file for the oneroster connector type.
#
# OneRoster is the standard specification for securely sharing class rosters and related data,
# between a student information system (SIS) and any other system.
#
# This sample file contains all of the settable options for this protocol.
# It is recommended that you make a copy of this file and edit it for your needs.


# Connection Settings
#(required, no default)
# Endpoint for organization's OneRoster implementation
host: "https://exampleschool-ca-v2.oneroster.com/ims/oneroster/v1p1/"

# (required, no default)
# API credentials for classlink server
client_id: 'client id goes here'
client_secret: 'client secret goes here'

# (optional, default value given below)
# unique key used throughout One-Roster (sourcedId is commonly used)
key_identifier: 'sourcedId'

# Simple Group Mapping
# When simplifying user group mappings, you may choose the default values that are appended to your group_name
# ie: When an English class is specified within the group mappings, after default values below are applied,
# "English" will be {default_group_filter}::English::{default_user_filter}

# (optional, default value given below)
# the default filter applied to the prefix of a plain group name. eg: classes::name::user_filter
default_group_filter: 'classes'

# (optional, default value given below)
# the default filter applied to the suffix of a plain group name. eg: group_filter::name::students
default_user_filter: 'students'

# (optional, default value given below)
# all users filter.  Use this with the --users all command line option to target all users
all_users_filter: 'users'

# (optional, default value given below)
# api call page size.  Adjusting this will adjust the frequency of API calls made to the server
limit: '100'

# # (optional, default value given below) user_email_format
# user_email_format specifies how to construct a user's email address by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific Okta profile attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value is from "email" field in Okta user profile.
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
user_email_format: "{email}"

# (optional, no default) user_domain_format
# user_domain_format is analogous to user_email_format in syntax, but it
# is used to discover the domain for a given user.  If not specified, the
# domain is taken from the domain part of the user's email address.
#user_domain_format: "{domain}"

# (optional, no default) user_username_format
# user_username_format specifies how to construct a user's username on the
# Adobe side by combining constant strings with attribute values.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# This setting should only be used when you are using federatedID and your
# federation configuration specifies username-based login.  In all other cases,
# make sure this is not set or returns an empty value, and the user's username
# will be taken from the user's email.
# This example supposes that the department and user_id are concatenated to
# produce a unique username for each user.
#user_username_format: "{username}"

# (optional, default value given below) user_given_name_format
# user_given_name_format specifies how to construct a user's given name by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific Okta profile attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value is from "firstName" field in Okta user profile..
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
#user_given_name_format: "{givenName}"

# (optional, default value given below) user_surname_format
# user_surname_format specifies how to construct a user's surname by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific Okta profile attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value is from "lastName" field in Okta user profile.
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
#user_surname_format: "{familyName}"

# (optional, default value given below) user_country_code_format
# user_country_code_format specifies how to construct a user's country code by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific Okta profile attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value is from "countryCode" field in Okta user profile.
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
# user_country_code_format: "{country}"

# (optional, no default) user_identity_type_format
# user_identity_type_format specifies how to construct a user's desired identity
# type on the Adobe side by combining constant strings with attribute values.
# Any names in curly braces are take as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# There is no default value for this setting, because most directories don't contain
# users with different identity types (so setting the default identity type suffices).
# If your directory contains users of different identity types, you should define
# this field to look at the value of an appropriate attribute in your directory.
# For example, if your directory attribute "idType" had one of the values
# adobe, enterprise, or federated in it for each user, you could use:
#user_identity_type_format: "{idType}ID"
